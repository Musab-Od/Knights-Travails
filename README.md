# Knights Travail

---

## 🔗 [Live Demo](https://musab-od.github.io/Knights-Travails/)

A visual representation of a knight traversing a chessboard to reach a destination using the shortest path.

### ⚙️ How It Works

- Click **"Place Knight"** to position the knight on the board
- Click **"Select End"** to choose the destination square
- Hit **"Travail"** to visualize the 'shortest' path (fingers crossed 🤞)
